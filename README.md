## Installation

You begin by running npm install to install Node dependencies. Then create a MySQL database (default ecommerce_db). Next execute the command npm run seed to seed the database with data. Then run npm start to run the API.

## Usage

You can use the app with standard GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP requests. The API uses JSON to format data.
